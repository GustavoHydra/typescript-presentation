Install React inside react-example folder (in the terminal: npm i react)

**Files:**  
**example.ts** -> File to see examples on how to use typescript (errors are on purpose)  
**react-example/index.tsx** -> File to see how to use typescript with React  
**exercise/exercise.ts** -> 4 simple exercises to test some basic knowledge of TS, there's a folder with possible solutions inside  
  
You can use the file "References.md" to see the list of some resources that I've used to make this presentation.
